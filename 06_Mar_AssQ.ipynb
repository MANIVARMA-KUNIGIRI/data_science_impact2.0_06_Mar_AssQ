        "In statistics, measures of central tendency and variability are used to describe the distribution of a dataset. They provide insights into the typical or average value in the dataset (central tendency) and how spread out the values are around this central value (variability). Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability along with explanations of how they describe a dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mean:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values.\n",
        "   - **Use:** The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and provides a balanced measure of the dataset's central location.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Median:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is sorted in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
        "   - **Use:** The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and gives a better representation of the central value, especially when the data has extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mode:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** The mode is the value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Use:** The mode indicates the most common value(s) in the dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Variability:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Range:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Use:** Range gives an idea of how spread out the dataset is. However, it is sensitive to outliers and might not accurately represent the variability in the presence of extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variance:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** Variance measures how each number in the dataset varies from the mean. It is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each number and the mean of the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Use:** Variance provides a measure of the overall spread of the data points. Larger variance indicates greater variability, but it is in squared units, so it might not be very intuitive. Standard deviation, the square root of variance, is often used for a more interpretable measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
        "   - **Calculation:** Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
        "   - **Use:** Standard deviation is a widely used measure of variability. It provides a more intuitive understanding of how spread out the data points are. Smaller standard deviation indicates less variability, while larger standard deviation indicates more variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "These measures, both of central tendency and variability, offer different insights into the dataset. Choosing the appropriate measure depends on the nature of the data and the specific characteristics of the dataset being analyzed."
